// How to validate that this optimization still works:
// - Boards that have dynamic allocation disabled compile (the OG __throw_system_error implementation is dragging in dynamic allocations)
// - Disabling this optimization increases FLASH usage by ~5 kB and RAM usage by ~ 200 B on the c1_debug_noboot target
#if __GLIBCXX__ != 20231009 && __GLIBCXX__ != 20240614
    #error Please check that this necromancy still works

// Magically (potentially) save several kB of flash and hundreds of bytes of ram
// The default __throw_system_error implementation brings in std::error_category,
// which brings in std::string (through std::error_category::message)
// Thanks to a basic implementation, the linker can throw all that away if you don't use it elsewhere
// __throw_system_error is marked as noreturn, so we are not removing anything important
