# OpenPrintTag-cpp

This directory contains a C++ implementation for the [OpenPrintTag data format](https://openprinttag.org).

1. The implementation is intended for use on embedded devices (it was specifically written for the NFC reader firmware). It has a low memory footprint and zero dynamic allocations.
1. The main class of this module is `openprinttag::OPTReader`. It provides a reader-focused API for managing multiple tags at the same time.
1. The `openprinttag::OPTReader` is agnostic to the NFC standard the tags work on. Tag communication is abstracted through `openprinttag::OPTBackend`.
    1. Communication with NFC-V tags is implemented in `openprinttag::OPTBackend_NFCV` in the `openprinttag_nfcv` module.
    1. There is also the `openprinttag::OPTBackend_Stub` in the `openprinttag_stub` module that provides the reader a virtual tag stored in the RAM.
1. The reader is also agnostic to the actual field definitions (defined in YAML fiels in the `OpenPrintTag` repository).
    1. There is however the `openprinttag_fields` module that provides C++ fields enums autogenerated from the aforementioned yaml files.
1. This module is covered by unittests, you can find them in `/tests/unit/module/nfc/openprinttag`.
