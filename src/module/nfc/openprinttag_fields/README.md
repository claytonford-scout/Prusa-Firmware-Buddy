# openprinttag_fields

Module that provides enums for OpenPrintTag-specification fields. The enums are auto-generated from the relevant `yaml` files from the OpenPrintTag repository (included as a git submodule in `/lib/OpenPrintTag`).

[See README](../openprinttag/README.md) in the `openprinttag` module for more information.
